This role also includes the permissions for all other Account Roles listed.

## Seller-side Account Management Roles

Accounts can also be managed by Administrators and Sales Agents. The Sales Agent allows a user to manage any account assigned to the role without granting administrative permissions.

To give a sales agent access to accounts:

1. Group your accounts in organizations using the Accounts Widget.
1. Associate sales agents with the same organizations.
