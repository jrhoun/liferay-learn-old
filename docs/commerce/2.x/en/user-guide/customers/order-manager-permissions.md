# Order Manager Permissions

Order Managers have all the permissions of buyers, and can also manage, delete and approve orders. The following permissions have been assigned to the Order Manager role. These permissions are the minimum. Although they can be removed, this will cause some changes in user access and abilities to make transactions on the Commerce site. However, more permissions may be _added_.

To view the permissions:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Roles_.
1. Click the _Site Roles_ tab.
1. Click _Order Manager_.
1. Click the _Define Permissions_ tab.
