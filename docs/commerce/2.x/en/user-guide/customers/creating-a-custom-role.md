# Creating a Custom Role

Liferay Commerce offers four roles by default: [Account Administrator](./account-administrator-permissions.md), [Buyer](./buyer-permissions.md), [Order Manager](./order-manager-permissions.md), and [Sales Agent](./sales-agent-perimissions.md). Before creating a custom role, review the permissions keys associated with the four roles first. As always, store administrators can add more permissions to each role.

If a store administrator determines that none of the existing roles are sufficient for particular needs, administrators can create a new role.

To add a new role:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Roles_.
1. Click the _Site Roles_ tab.
1. Click the _Add Site Role_ button.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: Customer Service Representative.
1. Click _Save_.
1. Click _Define Permissions_.
1. Select the Commerce permissions from the _Site Administration_ in the left menu.
1. Click _Save_.

Once the new role has been created, it will be listed in the _Site Roles_ menu in the Control Panel and also the _Account Management_ widget.
