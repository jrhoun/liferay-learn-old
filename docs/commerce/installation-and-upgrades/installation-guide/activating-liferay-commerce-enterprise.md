# Activating Liferay Commerce Enterprise

> **Subscribers only**

Liferay Commerce Enterprise is built on Liferay DXP. In additional to deploying the Liferay Commerce Enterprise `LPKG` file, it is necessary to activate Liferay Commerce Enterprise.

1. Once the subscriber has purchased the additional Liferay Commerce offering, open a [Help Center](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com/agent/) ticket and request the Liferay Commerce activation key.
1. The Liferay Provisioning Team will provide instructions on to download the Commerce [activation key](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018163571-Deploying-Activation-Keys).
    > Note that the activation key is tied to a particular server. To migrate an existing key to a different server, please contact the Liferay Support Team by opening a [Help Center](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com/agent/) ticket.
1. Deploy the activation key in the `{liferay.home}\deploy` folder.
1. Verify that the success message appears in the console.
