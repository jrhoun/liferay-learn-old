# Liferay Commerce Fix Delivery Method

**Subscribers only**

Delivering fixes is one of the essential services included with your Liferay Enterprise Subscription. For Liferay Commerce, we have designed our fix delivery method to match your project phase so you have ongoing access to the latest updates. Use the chart below as well as the definitions that follow to better understand how we provide fixes for Liferay Commerce.

Liferay Commerce is built on Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP). Therefore, Maintenance Updates to Liferay Commerce may required updates to the core platform by applying the corresponding fix packs.

## Development Phase: Maintenance Updates 

Maintenance Updates are periodically released for Liferay Commerce. Included in these updates are a collection of fixes that are carefully selected and uphold the quality and stability of the product by resolving known issues. Maintenance Updates undergo extensive QA testing and introduce significantly less risk than an Emergency Update. They represent the most current code base, and since Liferay focuses on resolving known issues in the current code base, we recommend that you stay up to date with the latest Maintenance Updates during your project's Development Phases. 

For the core modules and suites that are part of Liferay Digital Experience Platform, Maintenance Updates will be released as a single [DXP 7.1](https://customer.liferay.com/group/customer/downloads?_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_formDate=1542377673692&p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_product=dxp_71&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileType=fixPacks) fix pack through Liferay Connected Services and Customer Portal.

## Production Phase: Emergency Updates 

Emergency Updates are provided on a case-by-case basis for Liferay components that are deployed on production environments. If your Production deployment schedule limits the amount of changes you can make to your Production environments, or their frequency, we recommend that you request Emergency Updates from the Liferay Support Team. These updates are customer-specific temporary solutions that will be included in future Maintenance Updates. For Liferay Digital Experience Platform, Emergency Updates are also known as hotfixes which are short-term solutions that can patch the core modules and suites. If you have installed Emergency Updates, we highly recommend that you bring your Liferay DXP system up to date with the latest Maintenance Updates, as soon as you enter a new Development Phase.
