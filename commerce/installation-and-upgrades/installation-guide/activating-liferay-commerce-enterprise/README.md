# Activating Liferay Commerce Enterprise

**Subscribers only**

Liferay Commerce Enterprise is built on Liferay DXP 7.1. To use the enterprise version, subscribers must first have an existing Liferay DXP 7.1 instance.

To activate Liferay Commerce Enterprise:

1. Existing Liferay DXP subscribers should reach out to their Liferay account manager.
1. Once the subscriber has purchased the additional offering, Liferay Provisioning Team will provide an order ID so that he or she can download and deploy a Commerce [activation key](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018163571-Deploying-Activation-Keys).
    > Note that the activation key is tied to a particular server. If the customer wishes to update the key because they have a new server, he should open a [Help Center](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com/agent/) ticket or contact the Provisioning Team directly to update keys.
1. To obtain the Commerce Enterprise `LPKG`, navigate to the [Help Center Downloads page](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads?p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_productAssetCategoryId=118190997&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileTypeAssetCategoryId=118191001) and download the latest version.
1. See the article  [Deploying Liferay Commerce to an Existing Liferay Installation](../deploying-liferay-commerce-to-an-existing-liferay-installation/README.md) to begin deploying Liferay Commerce to the existing installation.
