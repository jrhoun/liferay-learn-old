* Activating Money Orders as a Payment Method

Liferay Commerce has the option to enable sellers to accept money order as payment. Because of the risks involved in this offline method, sellers should set forth their own policies on whether to accept money orders and under what conditions. Once this payment method is activated, buyers will be able to use money orders.

On the _Payment Methods > Configuration_ screen, vendors can also create an article that documents their policies on accepting money order. The editor allows you to embed tables, images, and videos inside the article.

To start creating an article,

1. Navigate to _(your Commerce site) → Commerce → Settings → Payment Methods_.
1. In the _Message_ field, create an optional note about any specific policies on money orders.
1. Click the (+) sign at the left side of the _Message_ field. The menu gives editors the option to add an image, insert a link to a video, or insert a table, or a horizontal line break.
