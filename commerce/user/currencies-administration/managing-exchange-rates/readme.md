# Managing Exchange Rates

By default, Liferay Commerce relies on the European Central Bank for foreign exchange rates. The ECB updates its exchange rates approximately every 24 hours; for more timely updates, a solution could be customized to use a different source.

To enable automatic currency conversion:

1. Go to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_. 
1. Click the _Currencies_ tab.
1. Click the _Exchange Rate_ screen.
1. Select _European Central Bank_ from the _Exchange Rate Provider_ dropdown menu.
1. Toggle the _Enable Auto-Update_ radio button to _Yes_.

The store is now able to update automatically the currency conversion rate from the European Cental Bank. By default, the rates will be updated every 60 minutes. 

To change the update interval: 
1. Go to the _Control Panel_ → _Configuration_ → _System Settings_.    
1. Click _Pricing_ in the _Commerce_ section.     
1. Click _Exchange Rate Auto-Update_.    
1. Enter a value in minutes: 120 (every 2 hours).
1. Check the _Enable Auto-Update_ checkbox.
