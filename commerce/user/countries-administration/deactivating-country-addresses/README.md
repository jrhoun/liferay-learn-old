# Deactivating a Country's Billing and Shipping Addresses

Liferay Commerce recognizes a scenario when site administators have to deactivate a country for shipping and billing purposes. There are several reasons for doing so, such as legal restrictions or practical business reasons.

This article documents how to deactivate a country in the Control Panel.

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_.
1. Click _Countries_.
1. Click on the country to be deactivated (Vietnam in this example).
1. Switch the _Billing Allowed_ button to _No_.
1. Switch the _Shipping Allowed_ button to _No_.

Note that at this point, only Billing and Shipping has been disabled. To completely remove Vietnam as an option when entering a shipping address, toggle the _Active_ radio button to _No_.
