# Account Roles

A role is a group of permissions collected around a particular purpose. The following is a description of each Account Roles. After assigning the appropriate roles, store administrators can allow customers to manage their own accounts and orders.

    * **Account Administrator** : Account admins can do anything. They can modify the account, invite users to join the account, and assign roles to other members. They also have all the other permissions that other account roles have.

    * **Buyers**: Buyers can view, create, and check out orders.

    * **Order Manager**: Order Managers have all the permissions of buyers, and can also manage, delete and approve orders.

A typical approach would be to enable a workflow on your site such that Account Administrators assign the roles, Buyers create orders, and Order Managers approve them. However, you can customize or create new roles as needed; see [Roles and Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017895212-Roles-and-Permissions) for more information.

## Seller-side Account Management Roles

Accounts can also be managed by Administrators and Sales Agents. The Sales Agent is a role that allows a user to manage any account assigned to him without granting him administrative permissions.

To give a sales agent access to accounts:

1. Group your accounts in organizations using the Accounts Widget.
1. Associate sales agents with the same organizations.

Sales agents can access any account within any of their associated organizations.
