# Accounts

Liferay Commerce stores information about customers in an account. An individual customer must be assigned to an account in order to make a purchase.

An account stores information about a customer. Accounts store shipping and billing addresses and, if applicable, a VAT number.

To manage accounts and the associated users, use the _Accounts_ widget in the _Control Panel_.

## Account Types

There are two types of accounts: business and personal.

A **personal account** stores information about an individual user. You don't need to worry about creating or managing personal accounts; they're created automatically when a user first logs in, using data from her profile.

A **business account** stores information about a business. Multiple users can be associated with a business account, and can be assigned unique [Account Roles](../account-management/account-roles/README.md).

The type of accounts you use are determined by your [site type](../../gettings-started/site-management-basics/site-and-site-types/README.md).
