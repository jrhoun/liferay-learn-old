# Inviting Users to an Account

This article documents how to invite users to an account. Corporate accounts can have more than one user assigned to handle various aspects of a transaction. There are two ways to add users to an account: using the _Account Management_ widget or using the _Control Panel_.

## Using the Account Management Widget

The _Members_ tab is where administrators can add additional users to an account. By default, accounts have one account administrator that is assigned during initial creation.
