# Creating a New Account Group

Account Groups allow accounts to be grouped based on business criteria, such as grouping accounts by geographic region (US West Coast, the Midwest, and the South). Sellers may then apply discounts or target marketing campaigns to specific Account Groups.

To create an account group:

1. Go to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Accounts Groups_.
1. Click the (+) button to add a new account group.
1. Enter a name: _US East Coast_.
1. Click _Save_.
1. The _Accounts_ link appears. Click the _Accounts_ link.
