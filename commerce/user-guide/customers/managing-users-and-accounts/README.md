# Managing Users and Accounts

Visitors to your store can open an account to manage their purchases and activities. Using their account, buyers can place and change orders in the B2B or B2C environment. Accounts such as those for corporations can have multiple users as points of contact for the entity to conduct their activities.

There are two possible ways to manage an account: 1) using the _Account Management_ widget and 2) through the _Control Panel_. Both achieve the same function with some key differences. However, access to the _Control Panel_ is restricted to those with store administrators or higher privileges and omni-admnistrators ("back office").

Each article below is a walkthrough on how to perform the following functions using both methods.

### Assign Account Roles

**Note 1**: It is __not__ necessary to associate an organization when creating an account. Moreover, the list of organizations are populated from the platform's default [Organizations](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018174351-Organizations) list and these have to be created separately.
