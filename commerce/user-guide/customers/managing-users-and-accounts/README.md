# Managing Users and Accounts

Visitors to your store can open an account to manage their purchases and activities. Using their account, buyers can place and change orders in the B2B or B2C environment. Accounts such as those for corporations can have multiple users as points of contact for the entity to conduct their activities.

There are two possible ways to create an account: 1) using the _Account Management_ widget and 2) through the _Control Panel_. Both achieve the same function with some key differences. Content in the _Account Management_ widget is site specific while the Control Panel is applied across all store sites. Furthermore, access to the _Control Panel_ is restricted to those with store administrators or higher privileges and omni-admnistrators ("back office").

### Invite Users to the Account

The account's _Members_ tab is where administrators can add more users to the account. All accounts already have one account administrator assigned during initial creation and more users can be assigned to this role.
