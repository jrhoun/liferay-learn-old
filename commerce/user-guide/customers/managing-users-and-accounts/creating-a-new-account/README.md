# Creating a New Account

Liferay Commerce Accounts are the means where buyers conduct their transactions in a B2B environment. Accounts store information including but not limited to: billing address, shipping address, payment information, order information, VAT number (as applicable). There are two types of accounts: Business and Personal.

There are two possible ways to create an account: 1) using the _Account Management_ widget and 2) through the _Control Panel_. Both achieve the same function; however, access to the _Control Panel_ is restricted to those with store administrators or higher privileges and omni-admnistrators.
