# Inviting Users

This article documents how to invite (add) users to an account. Corporate accounts often have more than one user assigned to handle all aspects of a transacation. There are two ways to add users to an account: using the _Account Management_ widget which is site specific or using the _Control Panel_ with global changes.

## Using the Account Management Widget

The account's _Members_ tab is where administrators can add more users to the account. All accounts already have one account administrator assigned during initial creation and more users can be assigned to this role.
