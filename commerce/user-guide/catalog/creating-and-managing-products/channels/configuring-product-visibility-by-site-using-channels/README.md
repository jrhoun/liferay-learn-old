# Configuring Product Visibility by Site Using Channels

By default in Liferay Commerce Products added to any catalog are visible globally - products are visible across all sites added to a Liferay Commerce installation. Store administrators may want to limit product visibility to particular channels based on their criteria.

For the purpose of this example, we will consider a scenario of a multi-region seller providing products from a single catalog.
