# Related Products, Up-Sells, and Cross-Sells

Product relations can be used to connect products. Once connected, a product displays the links to other products. Every related product must be assigned to a Product Relation Type. These products can then be displayed by a Product Publisher widget configured to source data from the appropriate type.

When more than one Product Publisher widget is placed on a product detail page, multiple sets of related products may be shown. For instance, one widget might display a set of products that are alternatives to the product featured on the page, while another might display products that are accessories to the featured product.

Note: If your site was built using an accelerator, then a number of product relation types are already in place. Here is a list of default Product Relations:

* **Up-Sell**: Display products that are comparable to the featured product but have a higher sale value.
* **Spare**: Display products that are spare parts or components for the featured product.
* **Related**: A catch-all set.
* **Accessories**: Display add-on products for use in conjunction with the featured products.
* **Cross-Sell**: Display products complementary to the featured product.

In the image above, the two related products are displayed in the Product Publisher widget at the bottom. You have the option to add more Product Publisher widgets configured with other types of Product Relations.

These two products are now associated with _Brake Pads_. Note that this relationship is unidirectional; in other words, when viewing _Brake Pads_ the new product relations will be visible but when viewing the _Brake Rotors_ or _Brake Fluid_ products, _Brake Pads_ will _not_ be listed as as a related product.

Once the product relationships have been created, configure the Product Publisher widget to display the relations.

## Displaying Product Relations

You can display product relations on a product display page by configuring a Product Publisher widget. You must have a [product display page](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017870292-Displaying-Product-Pages-) in place first.
