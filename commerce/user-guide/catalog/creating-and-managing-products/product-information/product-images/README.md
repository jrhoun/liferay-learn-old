# Product Images

Adding a product image helps potential customers view the product looks like. Viewing a product's image ensures that customers know what they are buying and at the same increases the likelihood of a sale. Store administrators can upload multiple images for all product variants (different SKUs).

This article documents how to add images to a product.

Roadmap:
1. Adding a single product image
1. Adding multiple product images. 

## Adding a single product image

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (in this example, _Microfiber Cloth_).
1. Click the _Images_ sub-tab.
1. Click the (+) button to add a Product Image.
1. Drag and Drop or click _Select File_ to insert an image.
1. Enter a title: _Microfiber Cloth_.
1. Set a priority: _1.0_.

    <img src="./images/01.png" width="700px" style="border: #000000 1px solid;">

1. Click _Publish_.

The new product image has been added to the product. Note that under _Options_, the message "_There are no options set as the SKU contributor._" appears. This means this particular product does not have multiple SKUs and thus this image is the only one associated with this product. See the section below on how to associate multiple product images to other product variants. 

To view the image in the catalog, go to the store site and then search for the product (_Microfiber Cloth_). 
    <img src="./images/02.png" width="700px" style="border: #000000 1px solid;">


## Adding multiple product images

As noted above, multiple product images can be associated with the same product. 

### Prerequisite

1. Product Options have been created for this product.
1. Multiple SKUs have been generated for this product.

### Associating a product image with a SKU

In this example, we can update an existing product image's settings so that this image is associated with this product SKU. 

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (in this example, _Microfiber Cloth_).
1. Click the _Images_ sub-tab.
1. Click on the existing image.
1. Select _Blue_ under the _Cloth Colors_ Options.

    <img src="./images/04.png" width="700px" style="border: #000000 1px solid;">

1. Click _Publish_.

This product image has been updated with the respective Product Option. Repeat these steps for all other available product images. Alternately, you can associate the product image with the Product Option when uploading the image for the first time.

## Additional Information

**Note 1**: that this is not the same as the __Default Catalog Image__. The __Default Catalog Image__ is the image displayed if a product does not have its own product image.
