# Adding SKUs to Your Products

SKUs provide a convenient way to inventory and price multiple product variants. This article describes how to automatically generate SKUs once Products and Product Options have been created in the catalog and how to add SKUs manually.

## Prerequisites

In order to auto-generate SKUs, the following must be completed:

* Product options templates have been created.
* Product options have been applied to your product(s).

See [Customizing Your Product with Product Options](../customizing-your-product-with-product-options/README.md) for more information.

## Generating All SKU Combinations (Automatic)

The fastest and easiest way to add SKUs to your products is use the _Generate All SKU Combinations_ feature.

It’s highly recommended all the product options (templates and values) be finalized for your product before using the _Generate All SKU Combinations_ feature.

Once your product options are created, here’s how to quickly and easily generate SKUs for all product variants:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (_Torque Converters_ in this example).
1. Click the _SKUs_ sub-tab.
1. Click the (+) button.
1. Click Generate All SKU Combinations.

The SKUs for Black and Gray Product Options have been generated. Repeat the steps for other products as necessary.

## Modifying a SKU (Manual)

When you create a product, a single SKU (named _default_) is automatically created. You may wish to manually change this generated SKU.

To modify this SKU:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (_Torque Converters_ in this example).
1. Click the _SKUs_ tab.
1. Click on a _SKU_ (_default_ in this example).
1. Rename the SKU: _GRAY_.
1. Leave the Purchasable toggle set to YES.
