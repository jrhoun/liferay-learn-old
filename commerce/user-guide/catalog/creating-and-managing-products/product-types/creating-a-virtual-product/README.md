# Creating a Virtual Product

A virtual product is any non-physical product. For example, the product is downloaded rather than shipped: a music file, a video, or an electronic publication. Virtual products could also include warranties and service contracts. Virtual products may be sold individually or in a Grouped Product.

For more information about each field, see the [Virtual Product Reference](../virtual-product-reference/README.md) article.

### Apply Product Options

You can apply [Product Options](../../customizing-your-product-with-product-options/README.md) templates to the virtual product. For example, an e-book might have alternate front covers depending on different markets.

Click the _Options_ sub-tab to continue.

### Set Prices and Quantities

To set product prices and quantities:

1. Click the _3-dot_ icon then _Edit_ next to _default_.
1. Click _Pricing_ on the left menu.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Price**: 12.00
    * **Promo Price**: 0.00
    * **Cost**: 0.00
1. Click _Save_. (If Promo Price and Cost fields are left as 0.00, no discounts or promotions are applied at this point.)
1. Click _Price List_ to apply this product to any existing [Price Lists](../../../managing-price/price-lists/adding-products-to-a-price-list/README.md).

>To learn more about pricing see: [Introduction to Product Pricing Methods](../../../managing-price/introduction-to-product-pricing-methods/README.md)

To learn how to configure inventory for your product, see: [Setting Inventory by Warehouse](../../../managing-inventory/setting-inventory-by-warehouse/README.md).

### Add Product Specifications

[Product specifications](../../product-information/specifications/README.md) contain useful pieces of product information about the product, such as dimensions, color, weight, capacity, or almost any other attribute. Click the _Specifications_ sub-tab to add specifications.

### Upload Product Images and Attachments

[Product images](../../product-information/product-images/README.md) help to ensure that customers know what they are buying. Each product variant (SKU) can have their own associated product image. Click the _Images_ sub-tab to add all product images.

Store administrators can also add attachments that are associated with a particular product. Click the _Attachments_ sub-tab to add documents.

### Organize with Categories

[Product Categories](../../categories/creating-a-new-product-category/README.md) are used to organize products. Product categories may be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified account or account group.

### Associate with Related Products

[Product Relations](../../product-information/product-relations/README.md) can be used to connect products. Once connected, a product displays the links to other products. Every related product must be assigned to a Product Relation Type.
