# Introduction to Product Types

The catalog supports three product types: Simple, Grouped and Virtual.

**[Simple Product](../creating-a-simple-product/README.md)**: Any physical product for which inventory is tracked.

**[Grouped Product](../creating-a-grouped-product/README.md)**: Two or more products from the catalog, packaged together to be sold as a single item. Grouped products are not tracked in inventory. Instead, the catalog tracks all of the products contained in the group individually. A grouped product can contain Simple Products, other Grouped Products, or Virtual Products.

**[Virtual Products](../creating-a-virtual-product/README.md)**: A virtual product is any non-physical product. Typically, a virtual productâ€™s inventory is not tracked. This may mean that the product is downloaded rather than shipped. Music files, electronic publications, services, and warranties can all be considered virtual goods.
