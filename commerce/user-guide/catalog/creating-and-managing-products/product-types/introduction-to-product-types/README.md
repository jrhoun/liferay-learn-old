# Introduction to Product Types

The catalog supports three product types: simple, grouped and virtual.

**[Simple Product](../creating-a-simple-product/README.md)**: any physical product for which inventory is tracked. Almost any physical item can be a simple product.

**[Grouped Product](../creating-a-grouped-product/README.md)**: two or more products from the catalog, packaged together to be sold as a single item. Grouped products are not tracked in inventory. Instead, the catalog tracks all of the products contained in the group individually. A grouped product can contain simple products, other grouped products, or virtual products.

**[Virtual Products](../creating-a-virtual-product/README.md)**: A virtual product is any non-physical product. Typically, a virtual product’s inventory is not tracked. This may mean that the product is downloaded rather than shipped, as in the case of a music file or an electronic publication. Other virtual products might be services, warranties, or other goods.
