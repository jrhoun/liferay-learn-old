# Creating a New Product Category

Product Categories are a great way to organize your products. These groupings allow multiple products to be handled as a single unit. For example, a product category could be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified acount or account group.

This article documents how to create a product category.

## Creating a Vocabulary

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → <img src="./images/01.png" width="25px"> _Go to Other Site_ → _My Sites_ → _Global_.
1. Once on the _Global_ site, click _Categorization_ → _Categories_.
1. Click the (+) button to create a Vocabulary first.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: Cosmetics
    * **Description**: All Cosmetics
    * **Allow Multiple Categories**: Yes

    * **Required**: Yes

1. Click _Save_. 

The new Vocabulary has been created and Categories can now be added.

## Creating Categories

Because categories can be nested, store owners can organize their categories with subcategories. For example, a category called _Hair Products_ could have its own subcategories such as _Shampoo_, _Hair Gels_, and _Color Dyes_. 

To create a Category:

1. Click the Vocabulary where the Categories are to be added. To continue the previous example, click _Cosmetics_. 
1. Click the (+) button to add a new Category.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: Hair Products.
	* **Description**: All hair products 

<img src="./images/03.png" width="700px" style="border: #000000 1px solid;">

1. Click _Save_.

The new Category has been created. You can either create another Category for another product that sits parallel in the hierarchy or create a nested subcategory in the description above. To create a subcategory, click the _Hair Products_ link and then click the (+) button to create another Category. Once the new Category has been created, you can see the breadcrumb navigation.

## Associating Categories with Products

Once the Categories have been created, begin associating them to the products in the catalog.

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_. 
1. Click on a product then the _Categorization_ tab. (If you used Minium to create a site with sample data, click _Transmission Fluid_. Note that the _Transmission Fluid_ product already has been linked to the sample Vocabulary and Category.)
1. Click on the _Select_ button under the label for the appropriate vocabulary, and in the pop-up that appears the check the box next to each category that applies.

<img src="./images/05.png" width="700px" style="border: #000000 1px solid;">

1. Click _Done_.

The category is now associated with the product.

Do the same for all other products that might fall under this category.
