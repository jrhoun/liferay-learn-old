# Setting a Product's Base Price

Each product SKU must have at a set base price. To assign one price to one SKU:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (_Torque Converters_ in this example).
1. Click the _SKUs_ sub-tab.
1. Click on a SKU (_MIN55859_ in this example).
1. Click _Pricing_.
1. Enter the following fields (example values shown below):
    * **Price**: 34.00
    * **Promo Price**: (leave it blank) (If you enter this field, then both the price above and promo price will appear on the product page so that buyers can see the markdown.)
    * **Cost**: 20.00

1. Click Save.

This product SKU’s base price, promo price (optional), and cost (optional) have been set. The _Cost_ field corresponds to your cost for this SKU which can help you track margins.
