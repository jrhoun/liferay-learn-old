# Introduction to Product Pricing Methods

There are several ways to price products and these methods are related to one another in a pricing hierarchy: base price, price list, tiered price, promo price and discount. This article explains the pricing hierarchy and each pricing method.

## Pricing Hierarchy

The pricing hierarchy determines which price applies for any given combination of product, quantity, buyer, date/time, order total, etc. If more than one price applies to a given transaction, then the price nearest to the top of the hierarchy supersedes others.

The hierarchy consists of these levels:

**Base Price**: This is the starting price of the product which is [set](../base-price/setting-a-products-base-price/README.md) in the product SKU sub-tab.

**Price List**: This price applies to specific products for buyers in selected [Accounts](../../../customers/account-management/creating-a-new-account/README.md) and [Account Groups](../../../customers/account-management/creating-a-new-account-group/README.md). Prices in the price list can be _higher_ or _lower_ than the base price. If a price list applies to a transaction, it supersedes the base price.

**Tiered Price**: This price applies to orders that meet specified minimum quantity requirements (bulk orders). It is only available in the context of a [price list](../price-lists/creating-a-price-list/README.md) and it supersedes the list's price.

**Promo Price**: This price can be applied to a base price, a price list price, and to a tiered price. Once applied, the promo price supersedes each of them. When a base price is superseded by a price list or tiered price, its promo price is superseded as well. _The applicable price and promo price appear together on the product page so that buyers see the markdown._

**Discount**: A discount _operates outside the price hierarchy and modifies a price_ rather than superseding it. Unlike a price list, a discount always reduces the base price. There are two types of discounts: a flat amount or a percentage. A discount can be applied in the following ways:

* By product (individually, by category, or the entire catalog)
* To an orderâ€™s subtotal, shipping costs, or to an order total
* To all buyers, or buyers in selected Accounts and Account Groups
* To a select group of customers that meet certain qualifications such as minimum order total or purchase of a required product.

The pricing hierarchy can be visualized in the following diagram:
