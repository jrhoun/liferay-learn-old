# Adding Products to a Price List

Once you have a [price list]() created, you can add products to it. This article describes two ways to add products to a price list.

1. Click on a price list (_VIP Customers_ in this example).
1. Click the _Entries_ sub-tab.
1. Click the (+) button.
1. Choose one or more products (_Premium Brake Fluid_ and _Premium Brake Pads_ in this example) to be added to the price list.
1. Click _Add_.
1. Click on a product (_Premium Brake Fluid_ in this example).
1. Enter the following fields:
    * **Price**: 100 (If you enter this field and not the promo price, the price you enter here will be the new price on the price list.)
    * **Promo Price**: 95 (If you also enter this field, then both the price above and the promo price will appear on the product page so that buyers can see the markdown.)
