# Adding Tiered Pricing

Tiered pricing allows store owners to vary the price of a product based on the quantity ordered. A store could offer reduced prices for higher quantities ordered. Prices that are set via Tiered Pricing will take precedence over prices set directly against a given SKU for the associated users if a buyer meets the minimum quantity specified. This article describes how to add tiered pricing to a price list.

To create a pricing tier for a product in a price list:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Price Lists_.
1. Click on a price list (_VIP Customers_ in this example).
1. Click the _Entries_ sub-tab.
1. Click on a product (_Premium Brake Fluid_ in this example).
1. Click the _Tier Price Entries_ sub-tab.
1. Click the (+) button.
1. Enter the following fields (example values shown below):
    * **Price**: 90
    * **Promo Price**: (leave it blank)
    * *Minimum Quantity*: 20 (This is the minimum quantity needed to receive the price for bulk quantity.)

1. Click Save.

A pricing tier ($90) has been created for orders that reach the minimum quantity (20) for the product (_Premium Brake Fluid_) on the price list (_VIP Customers_). Repeat the steps to add successive price tiers to the same product and price list (for other minimum quantities), or to add a price tier to another product and price list.

## Additional Information

**Note**: Price Tier Entries can also be reached by directly viewing Product SKUs.
