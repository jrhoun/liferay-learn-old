# Adding Tiered Pricing

Tiered pricing allows store owners to vary the price of a product based on the quantity ordered. A store could offer reduced prices for higher quantities ordered. This article describes how to add tiered pricing to a price list.

To create a pricing tier for a product in a price list:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Price Lists_.
1. Click on a price list (_VIP Customers_ in this example).
1. Click the _Entries_ sub-tab.
1. Click on a product (_Premium Brake Fluid_ in this example).
1. Click the _Tier Price Entries_ sub-tab.
1. Click the (+) button.
1. Enter the following fields (example values shown below):
    * **Price**: 90 (If you enter this field – the price for bulk quantity - and not the Promo Price, then the value you enter here will be the new price on the price list if the minimum quantity is reached in an order.)
    * **Promo Price**: (leave it blank) (If you also enter this field, then both the price and promo price will appear on the product page so that buyers can see additional markdown beyond the bulk price.)
    * **Minimum Quantity*: 20 (This is the minimum quantity needed to receive the price for bulk quantity.)

1. Click Save.

A pricing tier ($90) has been created for orders that reach the minimum quantity (20) for the product (_Premium Brake Fluid_) on the price list (_VIP Customers_). Repeat the steps to add successive price tiers to the same product and price list (for other minimum quantities), or to add a price tier to another product and price list.
