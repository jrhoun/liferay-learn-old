# Warehouse Reference Guide

Warehouses are the physical locations where product inventory is managed and shipped for order fulfillment. Store administrators can allocate inventory quantities to the warehouse(s) and Liferay Commerce automatically aggregates the total salable products. Liferay Commerce allows multiple warehouses for different geographic locations by city and country.

To manage your warehouses, navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_. Click the _Warehouses_ tab.
