# Measurement Units

Liferay Commerce comes with a number of common measurement units already defined, but if you or your shipping provider use different units, you may need to change the default settings.

There are two predefined measurement units defined: 1) dimensions and 2) weight. In each measurement unit, a primary unit must be designated: inches (dimensions) and pounds (weight). The primary units are the only units used by the catalog and by the variable-rate shipping method.

## Adding A New Measurement Unit

It may be necessary to add a new measurement unit; for example, centimeters is not listed as default measurment unit on the _Dimensions_ page. Likewise, the products shipped might be measured in a larger increment such as metric tons (tonnes) instead of kilograms.

To enter a new dimension (for example, centimeters):

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_.
1. Click _Measurement Units_
1. Click the (+) button to add a new dimension.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: centimeters
    * **Key**: cm
    * **Primary**: _No_
    * **Ratio to inches**: 2.54
    * **Priority**: 4.0

1. Click _Save_.

_Centimeters_ has been added to the list of dimensions. 

**Note**: Although the key is autogenerated based on the Name field, it can be best practices to replace the key with the accepted short hand for that measurement unit such as **cm** instead.


## Additional Information

If you use the Carrier shipping method to integrate your shipping cost calculations with a shipping provider's system, you must have the provider's units defined as well. If the provider uses units that are different from your primary, the conversion is handled automatically.
