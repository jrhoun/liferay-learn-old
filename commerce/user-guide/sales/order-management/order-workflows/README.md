# Order Workflows

This article explains _Order Workflows_ and gives an overview of the order workflow options available.

_Order Workflows_ are a site-specific setting that, if enabled, require the buyer or seller to give internal prior approval for an order before it can be processed.

With two _Order Workflows_ to choose from, _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_, there are four order workflow options available out-of-the-box.

1. **No _Order Workflows_**

    If no order workflows are enabled, buyers simply proceed from open cart to placed order, and sellers simply review _Pending_ orders, advance the orders to _Transmitted_ and fulfill them.

1. **_Approval Workflow_ (Buyer-Side Cart Approval) Only**

    If _Approval Workflow_ is enabled, the _Checkout_ button in the mini-cart is replaced with a _Submit_ button, indicating that the buyer must submit the cart for internal review and approval prior to beginning checkout. Once approved, the rest of the order life cycle (order placed, order transmitted, order fulfilled) takes place as normal.

1. **_Transmission Workflow_ (Seller-Side Order Approval) Only**

    If _Transmission Workflow_ is enabled, going from open cart to order placed happens as normal. However, when the _Pending_ order arrives at the seller, he must review the _Pending_ order and either approve it or reject it (sending it back to the buyer) prior to advancing the order. Once the order is approved, the rest of the order life cycle (order transmitted, order fulfilled) moves forward as normal.

1. **Both _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow Order Workflows_**

    If both _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_ are enabled, then the additional steps from both _Order Workflows_ are present.
