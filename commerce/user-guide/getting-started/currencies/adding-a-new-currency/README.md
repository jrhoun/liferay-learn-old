## Additional Information

### Notes

_Format Pattern_ requires the currency’s sign, the number of digits to come between commas, and which places are displayed. For example, in the format $###,##0.00 for US dollars, the places held by _0_ are always displayed (as 0 if no other digit is present) while the places held by _#_ are only displayed if occupied. A value of 0.01 in the above format would be displayed as $0.01.

_Rounding Mode_ requires a type of [rounding mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Directed_rounding_to_an_integer) from the drop-down menu.

Using [Mercanet](../../payment-methods/mercanet/README.md) requires EUR as the primary currency. Therefore, leave the default settings for Primary Currency to _No_ if using Mercanet.
