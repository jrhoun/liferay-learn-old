# Managing Payment Methods

To manage payment methods, navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _(your site)_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_ and select the Payment Methods tab. Select a method to edit it.

The _Edit Payment Method_ UI has three tabs: _Details_, _Configuration_ and _Restrictions_. _Details_ and _Restrictions_ are the same in all cases, but each payment method has a unique configuration screen.

**Details**: Each details screen contains fields that determine how the payment method is rendered in the Checkout widget. You can change the name, enter descriptive text, and upload an image.

You can also enter a number in the priority field to order payment methods in the Checkout widget. Lower numbers are listed first.

Enable the _Active_ toggle to make the payment method available to buyers.

**Restrictions**: A restriction deactivates a payment method for buyers in specified countries. To create a restriction, click the Add button and select countries from the list.
