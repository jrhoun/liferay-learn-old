# Shipping Methods

Liferay Commerce supports several shipping methods and carriers. Before choosing any shipping method, verify the [Measurement Units](../../sales/shipping/measurement-units/README.md) that the store will use. 

Here are several shipping methods:

* [Variable Rate](../../sales/shipping/using-the-variable-rate-shipping-method/README.md)
* [Flat Rate](../../sales/shipping/using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method/README.md)
* [FedEx](../../sales/shipping/using-fedex-as-a-carrier-method/README.md)

Shipping methods can be restricted based on countries or regions. See:

* [Applying Shipping Method Restrictions](../../sales/shipping/applying-shipping-method-restrictions/README.md)

## Additional Information

Note that Fedex is available only for Commerce Enterprise users. For users interested in adding other carriers, see:

* [Introduction to Shipments](../../sales/order-management/managing-shipments/introduction-to-shipments/README.md)
