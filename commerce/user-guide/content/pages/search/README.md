# Search

The Search page is where a site visitor can search for types of content other than the catalog. The Search page is not the same as the [Catalog ](../catalog/README.md) page, although there are similarities. Both pages contain search bars and several facet widgets that allow users to refine their searches. However, a specific Search page can be designed to display targeted content.

If using the [Minium Accelerator](../../../getting-started/accelerators/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store/README.md) to build a site with sample data, the Search page contains the _Search Bar_, _Search Results_, _Type Facet_, _Tag_, _Category_, _Site_, _Folder_, _User_, and the _Modified Facet_ widgets.

In this example, the sample Search page contains Knowledge Base articles and user profiles.
