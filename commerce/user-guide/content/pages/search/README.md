# Search

The Search page may be used to search for content that may be available on a Liferay Commerce site, including but not limited to: web content, knowledge base articles, documents, and images. The Search page contains a search bar and several facet widgets that allow users to refine their searches.

If using the [Minium Accelerator](../../../getting-started/accelerators/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store/README.md) to build a site with sample data, the Search page contains the _Search Bar_, _Search Results_, _Type Facet_, _Tag_, _Category_, _Site_, _Folder_, _User_, and the _Modified Facet_ widgets.
