# Checkout

The Checkout page is a required page that contains the _Checkout_ widget. This widget is populated once a buyer clicks _Checkout_ to submit an order.

During the checkout process, there are several pages to enter the buyer's shipping and billing addresses and choose a shipment method. The last two pages are the _Order Summary_ and _Order Confirmation_.

### Entering a Shipping Address

Note that if the buyer checks the _Use shipping address as billing address_, this will skip the Billing Address page.

### Selecting Shipping Method

### Entering a Billing Address

As noted above, this page appears only if the buyer's billing address is different from the shipping address.
