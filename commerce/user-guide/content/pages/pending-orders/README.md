# Pending Orders

The Pending Orders page is a page where order managers can view all incomplete orders associated with an account; an incomplete order contains items in the cart but has not been through the checkout process. In addition, the Pending Orders page contains the _Add Order_ button to allow order managers to create multiple orders at the same time.

The Pending Orders page uses the _Open Carts_ widget. If using the [Minium Accelerator](../../../getting-started/accelerators/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store/README.md) to create sample data, the _Pending Orders_ page has already been created and can be found in the site Navigation Menu.

The _Open Carts_ widget displays a list of orders associated with an account:

Once items have been added to the cart, order managers can review the pending orders before checkout.

If [Order Workflows](../../../sales/order-management/order-workflows/README.md) are enabled, the above mentioned steps may be slightly different.
