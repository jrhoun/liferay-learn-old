# Creating Your Storefront

Building a store in Liferay Commerce requires more than a complete catalog. Once the catalog is populated, store owners need to build a store front to display its contents to buyers. One way is to use an [Accelerator](../../../../getting-started/accelerators/README.md), such as Minium (B2B). Otherwise, without an Accelerator, store administrators need to create the display and landing pages manually.

The following types of pages have to be created:

| Page Name | Purpose | Widget(s) Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Account Management](./account-management/README.md) | Page where store administrators can manage users and Accounts | _Accounts_ |
| Catalog | **Main page** where customers can search for products and refine their search. | _Search_, _Specification Facet_, _Category Facet_ and _Search Results_.|
| Cart | Displays all items in the shopping cart | _Cart_ |
| Checkout | Displays a summary of all selected goods for purchase | _Checkout_ |
| Compare | Displays a side by side comparison of the different selected products | _Cart_ |
| List | Displays the customer's Wish Lists | _Wish Lists_ and _Wish List Contents_ |
| Pending Orders | Displays a list of all pending orders | _Open Carts_ |
| Placed Orders | Displays a list of all orders in all statuses | _Orders_ |
| Product Details | Displays information about the product and related products | _Product Details_ and _Product Publisher_ |
| Search | Allows users to search | _Search_ and various Facets widgets |
